Hi all,

Newbie here. I am investigating the practicality of implementing a Deep Q-learning Network using the NN lib provided by Deeplearning4j.
The network architecture is pretty simple, 2 hidden fully connected rectifier layers, 1 regression output layer.
Training method is simply SGD (for each sample, we pass in a target dimension and its target value)

Which part of the DL4J api should I look into first?
Thanks very much in advance!

The MultiLayerNetwork. Take a look at the 0.0.3.3 examples (https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-0.0.3.3-examples)
Build from master for now on this. This will give you the composable networks.
